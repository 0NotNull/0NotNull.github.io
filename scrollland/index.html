                <p>Red Greek wine grape that is indigenous
                    to the island of Crete. It is mainly
                    grown in the Heraklion regional unit and
                    sporadically on the Cyclades. The grape alone
                    gives moderately red wine with high alcohol
                    content and rich flavor. It is often blended
                    with Mandilaria, yielding a ruby-colored dry wine
                    with pleasant taste and aroma that requires minimal
                    aging. </p>

                <h2>LEARN ABOUT THIS VINEYARDS</h2>
                <p>Most of the vineyards of Crete are located in the eastern
                    section of the island, particularly its northern
                    side which benefits from the northerly and northeasterly
                    sea winds. The viticultural industry is experiencing brisk
                    growth, making the island one of the most significant and
                    dynamic terroirs of Greece. </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the vineyards of Crete are situated on the lowland
                    plains and on plateaus, at altitudes of up to 3,300 feet.
                    Most of them are linear although the traditional practice
                    of goblet training has remained in some. The mountain
                    ranges of Lefka Ori, Idi and Dikty traverse Crete,
                    featuring several dozens of summits, forming large
                    plateaus and gorges, and creating an endless diversity
                    of terroirs where the local varieties of Vilana,
                    Kotsifali, and Liatiko thrive alongside a plethora of
                    other native and international cultivars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cretan climate is particularly hot and dry,
                    with sunshine for 70% of the year and little rainfall
                    during the summertime (less than 2 inches). However,
                    these conditions are mitigated by sea winds and high
                    altitudes. These factors have facilitated the adaptation
                    of vines in Greece’s and Europe’s southernmost region
                    (latitude: 35º north). The majority of soils are clay
                    and limestone, with a high proportion of clay in many
                    sites. </p>
